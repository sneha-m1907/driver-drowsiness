THIS IS A DRIVER DETECTION PROJECT CREATED USING PYTHON AND OPENCV
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system will analyze video footage of a driver's face to detect signs of drowsiness, such as closed eyes, yawning, or head nodding. If the system detects drowsiness, it will trigger an alert to warn the driver.

Technologies Used
Python: As the primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
OpenCV: For image and video processing tasks, including face detection and feature extraction.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
Haar Cascade Classifier: For face detection.
Dlib: For facial landmark detection.
Real-time video streaming: Using libraries like OpenCV or FFmpeg.
